This is the code used on my MSc. dissertation. 

This repo is still a work in progress, dont try to run it yet.

## Dependencies

This work uses the RPS+ Toolbox available [here](http://povinelli.eece.mu.edu/itr-speech/download/index.html). This toolbox and any external dependencies is available on the `deps/` directory, that should be placed on your matlab's path.

## Running

First, run the `install.m` script to setup your mathlab path.
